# Drift Time

I'm trying to learn Rust since I got really tired of TypeScript and its bullshit so I thought making something cool and a bit complicated could be a good way to learn and also try to remove some bad habits of mine.

My goals with this project are the following:
- Creating an API, website and app in Rust.
- Have something to waste my spare time on without worrying on perfection.

## What is this?

For now it's an empty canvas but my main idea is to create a place where the **Drift Time** group can post screenshots, tag people in them (with visible squares), add details, have an advanced dashboard and more.

If I manage to even do that I will try more things in the future.

## Components

- API: Axum (Rust)
- Website: Yew (Rust)
- App: Tauri (Rust)

## License

To be honest i'm not really sure. I have to see how I feel about adding what license later.
